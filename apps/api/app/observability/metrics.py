"""Prometheus metrics (the RED method: Rate, Errors, Duration).

Exposes counters and a latency histogram, plus an ASGI middleware that records
every request and a ``/metrics`` endpoint factory. Labels use the *route
template* (e.g. ``/api/v1/items/{item_id}``) rather than the raw path to avoid
unbounded cardinality.
